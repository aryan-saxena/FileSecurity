<B><h2>Motivation</h2></b>
Imagine lending your computer/USB drive to someone. Now, definitely you will have some important files saved in your drive which you wonâ€™t want to lose, in case the person to whom you lent accidentally or deliberately modified or deleted them. This software comes to your rescue.
It will monitor a directory containing your important files and warn/alert you in case any modifications or deletions occur to them. It also has the capability to restore the original files back to the directory being monitored.
This software can also be used to restore important files accidentally modified/deleted by you or some virus or even your antivirus software.


<B><h2>Aim</h2></b>

The aim of this code is to create a simple user-friendly software that monitors a directory containing your important files for any deletions/modifications. It will show all that happened during the monitoring anytime later you want to see. It also has the capability to restore the original files entirely/individually back to the directory being monitored.

<b>Note</b>
This code uses some Windows(R) specific functions.
